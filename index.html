  <h2>Fridge List</h2>
  <h3>Assignment 2 for COMP 426</h3>
  <p><u><strong>Description of what Web Application Does:</strong></u> Fridge List allows people with busy schedules to easily create and organize grocery lists. Once you create an account, you can quickly store and organize grocery lists for later use. These grocery lists are tied to recipes, allowing you to determine what ingredients you still need for your latest culinary creations! More than that, the user can also use social networking features in order to create invitations for cook-outs and get-togethers! There will eventually be a "Sales" RSS Feed at the top always keeps users aware of money-saving opportunities for food-related purchases!</p>
