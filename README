COMP 426 project

This is the code behind the final project for COMP 426 in Fall 2013. It is intended as a display of a RESTful MVC.

The following parts follow a RESTful Architecture and serve as "resources" for the application:

* recipes.php
* users.php
* lists.php

Meanwhile, these files serve as other portions of the interface that the user interacts with:

* sign_in.php
* register.php
* index.php
* logout.php
